# Structs

  - set of variables, called fields or members, which can be of different types.
  - when you define struct TEstrutura you are defining a new type of data and this justifies the definition of a variable, in this case Register

## Method 1
struct TEndd { 
	//fields
 };

struct Address Register; 


## Method 2

typedef struct {
	//fields
} TEstructure;
    
TStructure Register
