## Here are several examples of implementations with Arrays 
1 - Read the statements and try to solve them by yourself 

2 - Try to compile your programs 

3 - Compare the results with the implementations in this directory, the filenames correspond with the name of the statement

Here are several examples of implementations with Arrays

1 - Read the statements and try to solve them by yourself

2 - Try to compile your programs 

3 - Compare the results with the implementations in this directory, the filenames correspond with the name of the statement

Exercises :

a - Calculate the sum of the first 20 even numbers in a 20 element array.

b - Build a program that calculates the sum of the sequence ( 2 , 8 , 64 , 4096 )

c - Build a program that calculates the total average of a class of 30 students. Ask the user for the average of each student and calculate the total average

d - Calculate the sum between two 3x3 matrices. Fill each matrix with the entries given by the user

e - Challenge! Ask the user to enter ten numerical values and sort in ascending order of these values, storing them in an array. Sort the value as soon as it is entered. At the end, show the values in order on the screen.
