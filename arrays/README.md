## Arrays

### What's array in C programming?
Arrays are data structures that consist of related data items of the same type.
Arrays are static entities, that is, they remain the same size throughout the program execution

### Declaring Array:

type c[n] ; 

Examples:
int integerNum[12] = { 1 , 2, 3 , 4 ,5 ,6 ,7, 8, 9 , 10, 11 , 12 } // create an Array with 12 elements of int type
